## How to Use the Admin Dashboard

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Follow the instructions in the README.md file to set up Supabase and Baserow
   - Configure environment variables

2. **Accessing the Dashboard**
   - Navigate to `/admin` to access the dashboard
   - You'll be redirected to the login page if not authenticated

3. **Managing Products**
   - Add products by clicking "Add New Product" on the Products page
   - Fill in the required fields (name, category, description)
   - Optionally add price, image URL, and other details
   - Edit or delete products from the product listing page

4. **Managing Categories**
   - View existing categories on the Categories page
   - If Baserow is configured with a categories table, you can add/edit/delete categories

5. **Viewing Analytics**
   - Access the Analytics page to see product statistics
   - View distribution of products by category

## Integration with Existing Site

The admin dashboard is fully integrated with your existing site:

- It shares the same theme system (light/dark mode)
- It uses the same styling approach (Tailwind CSS)
- It's part of the same React application, but isolated in its own routes

## Security Considerations

- All admin routes are protected by authentication
- Only authenticated users can access the dashboard
- Baserow API calls are made with your API key, which is stored securely in environment variables

## Extending the Dashboard

You can easily extend the dashboard with additional features:

1. **Add More Fields to Products**
   - Update the Product type in `types/product.ts`
   - Add the fields to the ProductForm component
   - Update the Baserow service to handle the new fields

2. **Add Image Upload**
   - Integrate with ImgBB, Cloudinary, or Firebase Storage
   - Add an image upload component to the ProductForm

3. **Add More Analytics**
   - Extend the Analytics page with additional charts and statistics

4. **Add Order Management**
   - Create new pages for managing orders
   - Add order-related types and services
